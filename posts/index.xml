      <description>It has been our dream for years now to open up a Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast, and with our background in hospitality, retail, art and wine we have found an ideal spot here in Newberg, Oregon to make that dream come true. We love being in the heart of the Willamette Valley where we are amongst the vineyards and close to the wineries yet close to town so we can take advantage of all those conveniences as well, and we are currently building five beautiful suites with all the amenities in mind to make you feel right at home when you come to visit!</description>
