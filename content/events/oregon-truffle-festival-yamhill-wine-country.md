Oregon wine and truffles: sheer bliss! We celebrate this singular pairing and explore the shared terroir of wine and truffles during our Yamhill weekend in the northern Willamette Valley. Taking place February 14-16, 2020, the Yamhill weekend offers an immersive package for a limited number of truffle aficionados, as well as an action-packed schedule of Ã  la carte events, including cooking classes and our annual Fresh Truffle Marketplace.
