Our home on the outskirts of town has stood for generations and has so much character. To learn more about its earliest history we visited the office of public records in Newberg and got the all the details. Shortly after Newberg was established in XYZ the property was acquired and the first structure built here. This house has quite a history and has developed real farm-house charm over the years.

In January of 2019 we started building the next chapter of this old house, and of our lives. After all the dreaming and planning the time had finally come to break ground and actually build it! While most of the house remains untouched, a completely new wing is being constructed. All of our guest rooms reside in this wing with modern electrical and plumbing infrastructure that will enable us to offer the most comfortable stay possible. Cozy gas fireplaces, high ceilings, private decks, heated floors, soaking bathtubs all make for a wonderfully relaxing experience.

We have been so lucky to receive all sorts of help from our Newberg community. We've worked with so many great folks - whether its tree trimming, general construction or just a neighbor lending a hand in the yard, we can count on them. Together our bed and breakfast is being realized faster than we imagined!
