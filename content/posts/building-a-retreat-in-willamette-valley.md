It has been our dream for years now to open up a Bed & Breakfast, and with our background in hospitality, retail, art and wine we have found an ideal spot here in Newberg, Oregon to make that dream come true.  We love being in the heart of the Willamette Valley where we are amongst the vineyards and close to the wineries yet close to town so we can take advantage of all those conveniences as well, and we are currently building five beautiful suites with all the amenities in mind to make you feel right at home when you come to visit! 

Our Inspiration
-----

Our work history took us to several western states as I worked in the hotel industry.  I worked in some beautiful resorts including Meadowood Napa Valley, La Paloma and the Salish Lodge & Spa.  There were other stops along the way to round out this experience at some other branded and independent hotels, but all of them contributed to learning the ins and outs of the hospitality industry and helping us craft our vision of what we would like to share with our guests.  

Our search for the ideal location finally landed us in the quaint community of Newberg.  We enjoy it here where the pace of life is a little slower and the people are so friendly.  Located on the northern end of the Willamette Valley means we’re close to Portland and have access to the PDX airport, but we still get to relax in the serenity of wine country.

It’s also nice to be closer to our sons, who graduated from the University of Portland and decided to stay in the area.  Our daughter graduated from the University of Denver and has settled in Denver, so she’s just a short plane ride away.

From the Ground Up
-----

Building the Bed & breakfast is a process that has been years in the making.  We looked at several other properties and drafted plans to work on each.  Since we didn’t have experience in new construction, each time we learned more about how things work.  Zoning, building codes, county requirements, setbacks to consider, and land use restrictions all came into play and we soon realized that it wasn’t as simple as finding a lot and building what you please.  

Locating the right property, in the best location, with topography that was conducive to construction was a challenge, so this was not some spur of the moment decision.  With Maureen’s artistic mind, she was able to help us envision how our dream could grow from what we visualized into a reality.  

Last year we purchased a 1930’s farmhouse on six acres and wanted to restore it to its original beauty, while planning the addition so that it would be a dream suite that would be unique, comfortable, spacious and relaxing.  The guest suites will all have ensuite baths along with king size beds, a fireplace and a private patio.  The baths have two-person soaking tubs, a separate shower and heated floors so you don’t have to step on any cold tile!  

Since we had to take down some things on the property to make room for the addition, we have worked hard to salvage and reuse as much of the original material as possible.  You’ll find the ship lap in numerous places that we think enhance the beauty and warmth of the house.  We had to remove a couple of Diodora trees and used them to make the tables on the patios.  There are other areas as well where we adapted the old to fit in with the new and we think you’ll appreciate them just as much as we do!

We have worked closely with the architect to put our dream on paper and now we are working closely with our contractor to make it rise out of the ground.  Every inch of the addition was built with a purpose in mind and reflects our character, and we couldn’t have made it this far without the support and encouragement of our families.  With their involvement we have been able to move forward with confidence and take it one step at a time.  My brother is building a custom dining table that is live edge spruce where you will sit with your new friends and share a gourmet breakfast each morning.  You’ll see several of Maureen’s creations throughout the property, but her most recent work is making a lovely home for our chickens that is fun and whimsical.  Surely it will make the eggs taste better!  We are also influenced by the beautiful northwest and several regional artists.  One of our favorites is Dale Chihuly and we hope to make our own version of his glass ceiling display that you will see upon your arrival.  

Where to Next?
-----

We are still in the construction phase and plan to be open in the fall.  Each day it is coming together little by little.  But we don’t want to rush the process because quality the most important factor in creating the environment we want you to experience.  While the entire project will be completed in phases, the first phase is completing the guest suites.  The rooms have vaulted ceilings and views of the Chehalem mountain ridge.  There is a beautiful great room where you can visit with your friends, play cards, watch sporting events or simply share a glass of wine.  

In future phases you’ll be able to enjoy the “sports arena” with a bocce court, horseshoes, a putting green, ping pong, shuffleboard, billiards and more.  We’ll also carve out “the meadow” where you can relax in a hammock while listening to the flowing creek or have a private picnic and watch for passing deer, or just read a book and take in the view of the surrounding orchards.  But first, we need to make your bed so you can relax after you return from a wonderful day of wine tasting.

Keep your eyes peeled for more updates on our construction process as we move even closer to opening. We are having a blast getting everything put together, and we can’t wait to share the next step with you!
