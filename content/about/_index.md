We started building the dream of our bed and breakfast many years ago. We are delighted to share our beautiful home with you. Maureen has a background in art and retail while Dan has a history in hotels and sales. After time in Napa and Washington, our love of wine has brought us to the Willamette Valley.

Our home is located 30 miles south west of Portland, Oregon in Newberg. This is our retreat from the busy city where we enjoy a slower pace of life surrounded by orchards and countryside.
