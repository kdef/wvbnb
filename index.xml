      <description>With the newly completed addition of guest suites, our bed and breakfast in Oregon wine country has had me thinking about the career events that have built up to this point. We have actually been preparing for years to be ready to welcome guests into our home, honing our skills in related industries in preparation for one of the biggest events of our lives.

      <description>It has been our dream for years now to open up a Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast, and with our background in hospitality, retail, art and wine we have found an ideal spot here in Newberg, Oregon to make that dream come true. We love being in the heart of the Willamette Valley where we are amongst the vineyards and close to the wineries yet close to town so we can take advantage of all those conveniences as well, and we are currently building five beautiful suites with all the amenities in mind to make you feel right at home when you come to visit!</description>
